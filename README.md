# Multi-Signature Wallet with Social Recovery

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
A decentralized **multi-signature wallet** smart contract that allows multiple owners to manage funds securely. Transactions require multiple approvals before execution. It also introduces a **social recovery mechanism**, where trusted guardians can help recover wallet ownership if an owner loses access.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
To provide a **secure, trustless, and user-friendly wallet solution** that minimizes risks of single points of failure and adds a social layer for recovery without relying on centralized institutions.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Multi-signature security**: Transactions require approval from multiple owners.
- **Transaction approvals**: Owners must confirm before execution.
- **Social recovery mechanism**: Trusted guardians can replace an owner in case of key loss.
- **On-chain transparency**: All transactions and approvals are visible on the blockchain.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- Add **time-locks** for recovery actions to prevent abuse.
- Introduce **guardian voting mechanisms** (majority approval for recovery).
- Support **ERC20 tokens and NFTs** in addition to native ETH.
- Implement a **front-end dApp** for easy user interaction.
- Add **biometric or off-chain verification** for extra recovery security.
